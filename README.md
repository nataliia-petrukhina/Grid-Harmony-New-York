# Grid and flexbox, living in harmony!
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


**Rules**

- Don't edit the HTML --> CSS changes only
- Don't edit the first 20 lines of CSS

**Instructions**

1. Make the `.container` element into a grid element
2. Make the grid have four columns, evenly spaced
3. Add 0.5em of space between the grid items
4. Create a flexbox out of all of the grid items using a vertical layout
5. Center all of the flexbox contents vertically and horizontally
6. Make the text color of the grid items `#eee` and give them a semi-transparent background
7. Add a box-shadow hover effect to the grid items, so that they seem like something happens when you click on them
8. Add other styling until your page matches the example screenshot below
